# Setup ProtocolBuffer and GRPC
This repository contains a simple example that enables you to test the environment for **ProtocolBuffer** and **GRPC**.

* You can import the project directly from a *Version Control System*, by providing the following URL: 
https://ewserver.di.unimi.it/gitlab/riccardopresotto/setup_grpc.git

* Otherwise, take care to import the project as a Gradle Project

* If required, trust the project and accept the Gradle auto-import

* Wait until the Gradle indexing process ends (it may take a few seconds)

* Compile the .proto files: 
	1. Select from the menu bar **Build** -> **Rebuild Project**
	2. Check if some files have been generated in the directory *setup_grpc/build/generated/source/proto/main/java*

* The testing files are located in the directory: *setup_grpc/src/main/java/researcher*
